## ⚙️ Configuration & Secrets (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT:** This repository does **NOT** contain sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys, etc.). You must create the following configuration files manually before running the application.

### 1. Backend Secrets (`application-secret.properties`)

Create a file named `application-secret.properties` in the following directory:
`Backend/BOOKWORM/src/main/resources/`

Add your secrets to this file:

```properties
# Database Password
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

# Google OAuth2 Client Secret
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

# Email Service Password (App Password for Gmail)
spring.mail.password=YOUR_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
```

### 2. Docker Secrets (`.env`)

If running with Docker, create a `.env` file in the `Backend/` directory:

```env
# MySQL Database Password
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally (Manual Setup)

### 1. Database Setup
1.  Create a MySQL database named `bookworm_master`.
2.  Import the initial data from `seed_data.sql` located in the root directory.

### 2. Backend (Spring Boot)
Open a terminal in `Backend/BOOKWORM`:

```bash
# Clean and install dependencies
mvn clean install

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Frontend (React)
Open a new terminal in `Backend/Frontend`:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```
The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or as specified).

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

This is the easiest way to run the full stack (Database + Backend + Frontend).

1.  Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2.  Navigate to the `Backend/` directory.
3.  Ensure you have created the `.env` file as described in the **Configuration** section.
4.  Run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
